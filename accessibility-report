# Equitable Use 

Login/Signup features are usable by anyone who can create and remember a username and password, and everyone is able to
benefit from the comfort of security. Features that could improve this design principle are accomodations (such as question 
read aloud features) that accomodate for the blind. 

#Flexibility in Use

User can use the features in any order they wish, and at any pace. Features such as Change Password allow for 
customization of user experience at any time, and there is no stigmatization in any individual's abilities 
(e.g. surveys are not timed, user session is not timed). 

#Simple and Intuitive Use 

Login/Signup have clear labels and required fields. GetMySurveys opens to an interface (a list of past surveys) that
is easy to understand. RespondToASurvey leads to a minimal screen with clear functionality : OK and Back buttons and 
an id input field. CreateSurvey has a top-down, intuitive survey creation UI starting with the survey title, then adding 
questions one by one, then pressing "Submit" when all done. 

# Perceptible Information 

Unfortunately, our application only uses visual methods of information delivery, but ensures a contrast between 
the background and essential information as all features have buttons and text fields with drawn borders, and
panels separate from the background. 

# Tolerance for Error 

CreateSurvey has a Delete question function to delete a question in case the user makes mistakes, and when creating a 
multiple choice question, has a "Delete" button next to each multiple choice option the user creates in case 
the option is no longer needed. RespondToASurvey has a warning popup when an 
invalid survey id is entered, and allows the user to try again. 

#Low Physical Effort 

All of our functions are organized in a linear navigation system, with no repetitive actions required except 
during survey creation. Features are easy to distinguish and stand out from the background to reduce eye fatigue. 

#Size and Space for Approach and Use 

With access to a computer, a user can use our application with minimum physical exertion. Our application 
requires a screen, keyboard and mouse to operate, and uses a simple typing and clicking interaction system. 

Our application would mainly be marketed toward businesses, but could also be useful in fields such 
as education. Our inspiration behind QuikSurvey was Google Forms, which is used in a variety of environments. 
For example, a survey could be created by a manager to gather opinions from his employees, or a teacher gathering 
requests from their students. In both cases, our application would allow them to easily distribute the survey as an 8-digit code,
see responses as well as recieve email confirmation about who responded. Our goal was to make QuikSurvey a free service 
that is accessible to anyone, as our belief was an easy-to-use questionaire system is useful in almost any area that 
values fast collection of information in a secure environment. 

As our application lacks multiple input forms (auditory, touch), it is less likely to be used by people with vision 
disabilities and people with disabilities that prevent them from operating at a computer. Adding features that allow this would 
increase user diversity, and would be an extension goal. Improvement that abides by the medical model would be speech 
recognition controls for those that can't type, and text-to-speech for the blind. With both, we are able to accomodate these 
two demographics better.
