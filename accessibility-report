# Equitable Use 

Login/Signup features are usable by anyone who can create and remember a username and password, and everyone is able to
benefit from the comfort of security. Features that could improve this design principle are accomodations (such as question 
read aloud features) that accomodate for the blind. 

#Flexibility in Use

User can use the features in any order they wish, and at any pace. Features such as Change Password allow for 
customization of user experience at any time, and there is no stigmatization in any individual's abilities 
(e.g. surveys are not timed, user session is not timed).
