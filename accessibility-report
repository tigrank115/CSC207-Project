# Equitable Use 

Login/Signup features are usable by anyone who can create and remember a username and password, and everyone is able to
benefit from the comfort of security. Features that could improve this design principle are accomodations (such as question 
read aloud features) that accomodate for the blind. 

#Flexibility in Use

User can use the features in any order they wish, and at any pace. Features such as Change Password allow for 
customization of user experience at any time, and there is no stigmatization in any individual's abilities 
(e.g. surveys are not timed, user session is not timed). 

#Simple and Intuitive Use 

Login/Signup have clear labels and required fields. GetMySurveys opens to an interface (a list of past surveys) that
is easy to understand. RespondToASurvey leads to a minimal screen with clear functionality : OK and Back buttons and 
an id input field. CreateSurvey has a top-down, intuitive survey creation UI starting with the survey title, then adding 
questions one by one, then pressing "Submit" when all done. 

# Perceptible Information 

Unfortunately, our application only uses visual methods of information delivery, but ensures a contrast between 
the background and essential information as all features have buttons and text fields with drawn borders, and
panels separate from the background.
